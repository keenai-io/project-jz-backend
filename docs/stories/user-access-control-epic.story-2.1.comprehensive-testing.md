<!-- Source: User Access Control Epic - Story 2 Task 9 -->
<!-- Context: Testing suite for completed UserManagement feature -->

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

## Story

**As a** development team,  
**I want** comprehensive test coverage for the Admin User Management Interface,  
**so that** we can ensure the feature works correctly, maintains quality standards, and prevents regressions.

## Context Source

## Acceptance Criteria

**Testing Coverage Requirements:**
1. Unit tests for all domain schemas and types with comprehensive validation scenarios
2. Service layer tests with properly mocked firebase-admin-singleton operations
3. Server action tests with firebase-admin-singleton mocks and auth verification

### Testing Approach by Layer

**Domain Layer Testing:**
- Test all Zod schemas with valid and invalid data
- Test branded types and validation edge cases
- Test schema transformations and parsing
- Cover error scenarios and validation messages

**Application Layer Testing:**
- Mock firebase-admin-singleton operations
- Test service methods with various data scenarios
- Test error handling and exception propagation
- Verify logging calls with proper context

**Server Action Testing:**
- Mock NextAuth session with admin and non-admin users
- Mock firebase-admin-singleton Firestore operations
- Test authorization checks and redirect behavior
- Test data transformation and error responses

**Hook Testing:**
- Use TanStack Query testing utilities
- Test data fetching, caching, and invalidation
- Test optimistic updates and rollback scenarios
- Mock server actions and test error handling
- Test loading and error states

**Component Testing:**
- Use React Testing Library for user interactions
- Test all UI states (loading, error, success)
- Test admin role-based rendering
- Test form interactions and validation
- Mock TanStack Query hooks for isolated testing

**Integration Testing:**
- Test admin route protection with middleware
- Test complete user status toggle workflow
- Test navigation integration with HeaderNavigation
- Verify feature isolation and vertical slice boundaries

### Specific Testing Requirements

**Firebase Admin Singleton Mocking:**
```typescript
// Mock pattern for service tests
vi.mock('@/lib/firebase-admin-singleton', () => ({
  getFirestoreAdminInstance: vi.fn(() => ({
    collection: vi.fn().mockReturnThis(),
    doc: vi.fn().mockReturnThis(),
    get: vi.fn(),
    update: vi.fn(),
    set: vi.fn(),
  }))
}))
```

**NextAuth Session Mocking:**
```typescript
// Mock admin session
const mockAdminSession = {
  user: {
    id: 'admin-user-id',
    email: 'admin@test.com',
    name: 'Admin User',
    role: 'admin',
    enabled: true
  }
}

// Mock regular user session
const mockUserSession = {
  user: {
    id: 'regular-user-id',
    email: 'user@test.com',
    name: 'Regular User',
    role: 'user',
    enabled: true
  }
}
```

**TanStack Query Testing:**
```typescript
// Hook testing pattern
import { renderHook, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react'
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query'

const createWrapper = () => {
  const queryClient = new QueryClient({
    defaultOptions: {
      queries: { retry: false },
      mutations: { retry: false }
    }
  })
  return ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) => (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      {children}
    </QueryClientProvider>
  )
}
```

**Component Testing Pattern:**
```typescript
// Component test setup
import { render, screen, userEvent } from '@testing-library/react'
import { SessionProvider } from 'next-auth/react'

const renderWithSession = (component: React.ReactElement, session: any) => {
  return render(
    <SessionProvider session={session}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={testQueryClient}>
        {component}
      </QueryClientProvider>
    </SessionProvider>
  )
}
```

### Coverage Requirements

**Target Coverage Areas:**
- Domain schemas: 100% (critical validation logic)
- Service layer: 90% (business logic)
- Server actions: 90% (security-critical)
- Hooks: 85% (data management)
- Components: 80% (UI behavior)
- Overall feature: 80% minimum

**Test Categories:**
- Happy path scenarios
- Error handling and edge cases
- Authorization and security
- Loading and error states
- User interactions and form validation
- Data transformation and validation
- Optimistic updates and rollback

### Performance Testing Considerations

**Load Testing:**
- Test user list rendering with large datasets
- Test pagination and virtual scrolling if implemented
- Verify no memory leaks in long-running tests

**Optimization Testing:**
- Test TanStack Query caching behavior
- Verify optimistic updates don't cause race conditions
- Test component re-rendering optimization

## Risk Assessment

### Testing Risks

- **Primary Risk**: Mocking firebase-admin-singleton incorrectly causing tests to pass but feature to fail
- **Mitigation**: Use existing mock patterns, verify mocks match real API, add integration tests
- **Verification**: Test with real Firebase emulator in CI/CD pipeline

- **Secondary Risk**: Test suite becoming too slow due to comprehensive coverage
- **Mitigation**: Optimize test setup, use proper mocking, parallel test execution
- **Verification**: Monitor test execution time, optimize slow tests

- **Third Risk**: Tests becoming brittle due to implementation details testing
- **Mitigation**: Focus on behavior testing, use React Testing Library best practices
- **Verification**: Regular test review and refactoring

### Quality Assurance

- **Test Reliability**: All tests must be deterministic and independent
- **Test Maintainability**: Tests should be easy to understand and modify
- **Test Performance**: Test suite should run efficiently in CI/CD
- **Test Coverage**: Must achieve 80% minimum without compromising quality

## Notes

This story focuses exclusively on creating comprehensive test coverage for the already-implemented UserManagement feature. The testing approach follows the vertical slice architecture pattern and existing testing conventions in the codebase. All tests must maintain the high quality standards established in CLAUDE.md while ensuring the feature is thoroughly validated and protected against regressions.
