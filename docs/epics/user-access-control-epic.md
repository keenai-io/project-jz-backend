# User Access Control System - Brownfield Enhancement Epic

## Epic Overview

**Epic Title:** User Access Control System - Brownfield Enhancement  
**Epic Goal:** Enable administrator-controlled access management for product categorization features, allowing admins to approve or disable new user access while maintaining existing authentication flow through NextAuth v5 and Firestore.  
**Created:** August 2025  
**Status:** Planning Complete  

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context
- **Current relevant functionality:** NextAuth v5 authentication with Google OAuth and Firestore integration
- **Technology stack:** Next.js 15, NextAuth v5, Firestore, Google OAuth provider
- **Integration points:** NextAuth session callbacks, Firestore user document storage, product categorization feature access points

### Enhancement Details
- **What's being added/changed:** Adding admin role system and user enabled/disabled status with admin interface for user management
- **How it integrates:** Extends existing user documents in Firestore with `role` and `enabled` fields, enhances NextAuth callbacks for role-based access
- **Success criteria:** Admins can view all users and toggle their access; disabled users cannot access categorization features
- **Security model:** New users default to `enabled: false` requiring admin approval; existing users remain enabled for backward compatibility

## Stories

### Story 1: Add User Role and Status Fields to Authentication System
**Priority:** HIGH - Foundation for entire epic

#### User Story
As a system administrator,  
I want user accounts to have role and enabled status tracking,  
So that I can control access to product categorization features.

#### Story Context
**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: NextAuth v5 authentication system and Firestore user documents
- Technology: NextAuth v5, Firestore, TypeScript
- Follows pattern: Existing user document creation and session management
- Touch points: NextAuth callbacks, Firestore user collection, session object

#### Acceptance Criteria
**Functional Requirements:**
1. Firestore user documents include `role` field (values: 'admin', 'user') 
2. Firestore user documents include `enabled` field (boolean, defaults to true)
3. NextAuth session includes role and enabled status from Firestore

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing user authentication flow continues to work unchanged
5. New user registration follows existing Google OAuth pattern with new fields
6. Integration with NextAuth session/JWT callbacks maintains current behavior while adding new data

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Database migration safely updates existing user documents
8. NextAuth callback tests cover new field handling
9. No regression in existing authentication functionality verified

#### Technical Notes
- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing NextAuth callbacks to fetch and include role/enabled fields in session
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow current user document structure in Firestore and session callback pattern
- **Key Constraints:** Must default existing users to enabled=true, role='user' to maintain current access

#### Definition of Done
- [ ] User documents have role and enabled fields with proper defaults
- [ ] NextAuth session includes role and enabled status
- [ ] Existing users can still authenticate and access all current features
- [ ] New user registration includes proper field initialization
- [ ] Migration script tested and applied safely
- [ ] Session callback tests pass with new fields

### Story 2: Build Admin User Management Interface  
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Depends on Story 1  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

#### User Story
As an admin user,  
I want a management interface to view all users and control their access,  
So that I can approve new users and manage access to product categorization.

#### Story Context
**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Existing Next.js 15 app routing and UI component patterns
- Technology: Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS, existing UI components

### Story 3: Implement Access Control for Product Categorization  
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Depends on Stories 1 & 2  
**Status:** ✅ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED (Home page protection complete)

#### User Story
As a system administrator,  
I want disabled users to be blocked from all application features including the home page,  
So that I can control who has access to the application.

#### Story Context
**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Existing product categorization feature access points
- Technology: Next.js 15, existing categorization components and routes
- Follows pattern: Existing permission checking and route protection
- Touch points: Categorization page routes, feature access components

#### Acceptance Criteria
**Functional Requirements:**
1. ✅ Disabled users cannot access the home page (implemented)
2. ✅ Disabled users see "Account Pending Approval" page instead of application features (implemented)
3. ✅ Enabled users maintain full access to home page and all features (implemented)
4. ⏳ Disabled users cannot access product categorization pages (pending)
5. ⏳ Disabled users cannot access admin interfaces (pending)

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing enabled users continue to access categorization without disruption
5. New access control follows existing authentication/authorization patterns
6. Integration with existing categorization features maintains current performance

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Access control checks are consistent across all categorization entry points
8. User-friendly messaging for disabled users explains status
9. No performance degradation for enabled users accessing features

#### Technical Notes
- **Integration Approach:** Add enabled status checks to categorization route middleware and components
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow current authentication checking patterns in middleware.ts
- **Key Constraints:** Must not impact performance or experience for enabled users

#### Definition of Done
- [x] ✅ Disabled users cannot access home page

interface User {
  // ... existing fields
  role: 'admin' | 'user';        // New field, defaults to 'user'
  enabled: boolean;              // New field, defaults to true
  lastLogin?: Timestamp;         // Optional: track user activity
}
```

### NextAuth Session Extension
```typescript
// Extended session object
interface ExtendedSession extends Session {
  user: {
    // ... existing user fields
    role: 'admin' | 'user';
    enabled: boolean;
  }
}
```

### Route Protection Pattern
```typescript
// Middleware extension for admin routes
if (pathname.startsWith('/admin')) {
  const isAdmin = session?.user?.role === 'admin';
  if (!isAdmin) {
    return NextResponse.redirect('/signin');
  }
}
```
